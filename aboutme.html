                        <p>My name is David Ellis and I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer.  I have recently completed the University Of Denver Full Stack Web Development boot camp, where I developed a passion for coding that I am now excitedly pursuing with further projects (currently a React/Expo mobile app).  I am always eager to learn something new and collaborate, so feel free to reach out to me using the contact page!</p>         
                        <p>Rather than talk more about myself, here's 25 coding jokes for you to enjoy:</p>
