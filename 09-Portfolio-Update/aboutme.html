                        <p class="content-about-me-quote">"It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn. Maybe thatâ€™s enlightenment enough - to know that there is no final resting place of the mind, no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom, at least for me, means realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go."</p>
                        <p class="content-about-me-quote content-about-me-quote-credit">- Anthony Bourdain</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Anthony Bourdain had a passion for exploring the world around him.  He made a very deliberate effort to meet new people, try different things, and discover foreign places.  He likely appreciated the power of these experiences to develop his understanding of the world, of life, and himself.  I share this passion, and explore the world by spending my spare time seeing concerts, hiking mountains, travelling, meeting different people, and undertaking new challenges.  I'm always learning new things, unlearning old things, and constantly reminded how small my window to the world must be.  I am often reminded to keep a curious and open mind.</p>         
                        <p>My latest endeavor has been into Full-Stack Web Development, and it's been a humbling experience.  There is so much to learn, and even with an unrelenting passion for development and growth, there will always be more to know.  But, armed with determination and vision, I know that great things can be achieved.  I plan to learn from those around me and continually build my skill set, while being of assistance to others whenever I can.<p>
