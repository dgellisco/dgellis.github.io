            <p class="content-profile-quote">"It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn. Maybe thatâ€™s enlightenment enough - to know that there is no final resting place of the mind, no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom, at least for me, means realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go."</p>
            
            <p class="content-profile-quote content-profile-quote-credit">- Anthony Bourdain</p>

            <p>Anthony Bourdain had a passion for exploring the world around him, for having new experiences, for meeting people from all walks of life, and for developing an understanding of life and himself in the process.  I, too, share his passion, aswell as his ironic sense of loss knowing that one can never possibly see and do it all.  Nevertheless, I live life with curiosity and passion - spending every spare moment seeing concerts, hiking mountains, travelling the world, meeting new people, and challenging myself with new endeavours.  Every experience reminds me how diverse the human experience is, and therefore how little I know.  These reminders help to nurture an ever curious and open mind.</p>
            
            <p>My latest undertaking is into Full-Stack Web Development, and it has been a humbling experience.  There is so much to learn and so much to know, yet even with an unrelenting passion for development and growth, I must admit I will never truly know it all.  But, armed with such a passion, one can certainly achieve great things, and be an asset to those around them.  That is who I am, and who I aspire to be.<p>
