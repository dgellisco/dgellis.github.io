            <p class="content-profile-quote">"It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn. Maybe thatâ€™s enlightenment enough - to know that there is no final resting place of the mind, no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom, at least for me, means realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go."</p>
            
            <p class="content-profile-quote content-profile-quote-credit">- Anthony Bourdain</p>

            <p>Anthony Bourdain had a passion for exploring the world around him, for having new experiences, for meeting different people, and for developing an understanding of life and himself in the process.  I share his passion (aswell as an ironic sense of loss knowing that one can never possibly see and do it all).  Nevertheless, I live my life with interest and excitement - spending my spare moments seeing concerts, hiking mountains, travelling, meeting different people, and undertaking new challenges.  Every new experience reminds me how diverse the human experience can be, and how small my window to the world must be.  I'm reminded to always keep a curious and open mind.</p>
            
            <p>My latest endeavor, into Full-Stack Web Development, has been a humbling experience.  There is so much to learn and so much to know, yet even with an unrelenting passion for development and growth, there'll always be more to learn.  But, armed with determination and a little bit of ingenuity, one can certainly achieve great things, continue to build their skill set, and be both an aid and an asset to those around them.  That is the goal, both in life and coding!<p>
