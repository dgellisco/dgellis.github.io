            <p class="content-profile-quote">"It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn. Maybe thatâ€™s enlightenment enough - to know that there is no final resting place of the mind, no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom, at least for me, means realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go."</p>
            
            <p class="content-profile-quote content-profile-quote-credit">- Anthony Bourdain</p>

            <p>Anthony Bourdain had a passion for exploring the world around him.  He appreciated the power of new experiences and of meeting new people to develop his understanding of life, and himself, in the process.  I feel I share his passion, aswell as an ironic sense of loss knowing that one can never possibly see and do it all.  Nevertheless, I live my life with passion and excitement - spending my spare moments seeing concerts, hiking mountains, travelling, meeting different people, and occasionally undertaking new challenges.  I'm often reminded how diverse the human experience can be, and how small my window to the world must be.  I'm often reminded to keep a curious and open mind.</p>
            
            <p>My latest endeavor, into Full-Stack Web Development, has also been a humbling experience.  There is so much to learn and so much to know, yet even with an unrelenting passion for development and growth, there'll always be more to learn.  But armed with determination and a little bit of ingenuity one can certainly achieve great things, continually build their skill set, and hopefully be both an aid and an asset to those around them.  That's the goal, both in life and coding!<p>
